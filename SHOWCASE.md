## Technical Showcase

### Memory Management
```php
// AI Flow suggested this memory-efficient approach
public function processLargeImage(string $path): void
{
    $this->memoryManager->calculateRequired($path);
    $this->memoryManager->allocate();
    
    try {
        $this->streamProcessor->process($path);
    } finally {
        $this->memoryManager->release();
    }
}
```

### Error Handling
```php
// AI Flow helped design this comprehensive error handling
public function removeMetadata(string $path): void
{
    try {
        $this->validator->validate($path);
        $this->processor->process($path);
    } catch (ValidationException $e) {
        $this->logger->error('Validation failed', [
            'path' => $path,
            'reason' => $e->getMessage()
        ]);
        throw $e;
    } catch (ProcessingException $e) {
        $this->logger->error('Processing failed', [
            'path' => $path,
            'context' => $e->getContext()
        ]);
        throw $e;
    }
}
```
