## Technical Innovation

### 1. Smart Architecture
```php
// AI Flow suggested this modular approach
interface ImageHandlerInterface
{
    public function supports(string $format): bool;
    public function removeMetadata(string $path): void;
    public function validate(string $path): void;
}

class JpegHandler implements ImageHandlerInterface
{
    public function supports(string $format): bool
    {
        return strtolower($format) === 'jpeg';
    }
    
    // Implementation details...
}
```

### 2. Advanced Error Handling
```php
// AI Flow helped design this error system
class BaseException extends Exception
{
    private array $context;
    
    public function __construct(string $message, array $context = [])
    {
        $this->context = $this->sanitizeContext($context);
        parent::__construct($message);
    }
    
    public function getContext(): array
    {
        return $this->context;
    }
}
```

### 3. Performance Optimization
```php
// AI Flow suggested these optimizations
class StreamProcessor
{
    public function process(string $path): void
    {
        $handle = fopen($path, 'r+b');
        try {
            while (!feof($handle)) {
                $chunk = fread($handle, 8192);
                $this->processChunk($chunk);
            }
        } finally {
            fclose($handle);
        }
    }
}
```
